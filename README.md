## What this is:
A React front-end consuming data from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) and displaying that data on a list of flippable cards.  
Mouse-over a card to see more information on planets.  
This is a fun little project I've been messing-around with for a bit.

## Dependencies
1. react
1. react-particles-js (starry background)
1. tachyons (simplified css in-line with JSX)

## To run locally,
`$ git clone https://github.com/scott96707/starWars.git`  
`$ npm install`  
`$ npm run-script dev`
